All times captured using ubuntu vm and desktop pc.
Relative performance is what we care about, not absolute performance.

1)First correct solution: 54.06s
2)Use sets and split results: 49.3s
3)Rework algorithm: 38.8s
4)Rework algo again: 4.9s (calculate 10 at a time.)
5)Use smaller set and subtract: 4.6s
6)Rework algo again: 1.7s (calculate 1000 at a time.)



Note after step 5:
I believe the performance could be improved by another factor of 10 by applying the same algo improvement again.
Calculate 0->10,000, use this to calc up to 100,0000, etc. You would essentially be doing 100 at a time instead of 10.

Note after step 6:
I tried what the note above describes. Got a speedup of 3x.
