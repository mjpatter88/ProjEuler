All times captured using ubuntu vm and desktop pc.
Relative performance is what we care about, not absolute performance.

First correct solution: 54.06s
Use sets and split results: 49.3s
Rework algorithm: 38.8s
Rework algo again: 4.9s (calculate 10 at a time.)
Use smaller set and subtract: 4.6s



I believe the performance could be improved by another factor of 10 by applying the same algo improvement again.
Calculate 0->10,000, use this to calc up to 100,0000, etc. You would essentially be doing 100 at a time instead of 10.
