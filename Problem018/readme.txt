I'd llke to solve this problem two ways.
First I'll write a recursive brute force method.
Then I'll write a dynamic programming method.
I'll compare the performance, and then try the dp method on problem 67.

Maybe just use a jagged array and don't even use a data structure at all?

I think I'll try this in C++. It would be easier for me in Java, C, or Python, but this will provide a good
challenge and force me to practice C++.

I think the input file should basically look like:

75
95 64
17 47 82
...

(This is also the format used in problem 67. Also in both problems all values are 2 digit numbers.)
I can maybe pull all the text out of the website source? Will have to check on this.
Done. Numbers now in the "numbers.txt" file.
